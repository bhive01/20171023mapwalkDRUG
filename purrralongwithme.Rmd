Let's load tidyverse
``` {r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```


Data types
```{r vector intiation}
#initiate blank vectors of a specific type
#this can be useful when capturing data from for loops
a <- vector("logical", 5)
a
b <- vector("integer", 4)
b
c <- vector("double", 2) # can also use "numeric"
c
d <- vector("character", 10)
d
e <- vector("complex", 7)
e
f <- vector("raw", 3)
f
g <- list()
g
```
NAs
```{r NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA Batman}
#what do the NAs look like?
list(NA, NA_integer_, NA_real_, NA_character_, NA_complex_)
#not very exciting
```

The NULL element
``` {r NULLs}
# NULL is the absence of a vector
a <- NULL

mtcars
mtcars[1] <- NULL #this gets rid of the mpg coloumn completely
mtcars

data(mtcars) # restore mtcars

```

Vectors can be assembled by list()
```{r Vectors Victor, error = TRUE}
# let's put actual values into these
a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, NA) #seems logical 
b <- c(1:7, NA_integer_) #Integers
c <- c(rnorm(8), NA_real_) #pull doubles from normal distribution
d <- c(LETTERS[1:3], NA_character_) #first 5 capital letters

e <- list(a, b, c, d) #make a list

e # check it twix

#Lists can contain anything of any length
#data.frame is a special type of list

data.frame(a, b) # uh oh
#equal lengths are required when making a df

a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, NA, NA, NA) # make it 8 like b
df <- data.frame(a = a, b = b) # OH YEAH /Koolaidman.gif
df 
#tibbles are a strict type of data.frame
as_tibble(df)
# with slightly more informative printing


```




This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
