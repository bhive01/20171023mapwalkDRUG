Data types
```{r data types}
#initiate blank vectors of a specific type
#this can be useful when capturing data from for loops
a <- vector("logical", 5)
b <- vector("integer", 5)
c <- vector("double", 5)
d <- vector("character", 5)
e <- list()

# let's put actual values into these
a <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE) #seems logical 
b <- c(1:5) #Integers
c <- rnorm(5) #pull doubles from normal distribution
d <- LETTERS[1:5] #first 5 capital letters
e <- list(a, b, c, d) #make a list

e # check it twix
```

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
