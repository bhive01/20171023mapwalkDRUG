Intro

A lot of what we do as humans is break down complex problems into pieces that can be repeated. This increases efficiency and allows us to focus on more complex problems. 

Iteration helps us deal with these repetitive tasks. 

Iteration in R
R let's you do things in many different ways
Package system allows this to be extended in infinite ways.



For loops
seqalong
apply family
data.table (don't know how to do this, but should show an example)

Tidyverse:purrr:: Map/Walk Family
