Steph suggested a read in documents example with map_df
http://data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-the-purrr-package-in-r/
Mix with this your new readtxtfromfolder2() function to import filenames and timestamps as columns

Jenny has a huge purrr site 
https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/
Specific page mentioning how you can use the various functions
https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls03_map-function-syntax.html

What else have I used it for? 
Nested datasets, iterate over them and do stuff.
Iterate over them and plot
iterate over them and print a paragraph about the plot and its data in an RmD



Should mention how you use map, map2, pmap
map = ., map2 = .x;.y, pmap = .1;.2;.3;etc...
This was difficult for me to figure out, spend some time on it.
